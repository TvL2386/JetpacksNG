###Why did you create this mod?

I've always wanted to learn Java and was curious about how hard it would be to create a mod for Minecraft. Minecraft 1.10.2 was lacking jetpacks when I started creating this mod, so JetpacksNG was born! Please keep in mind this is my first attempt and I'm sure I've made numerous errors and/or rookie mistakes. Anyway: I had fun and now I'm flying around in my Direwolf20 1.1.3 (MC1.10.2) server!!!

###Credits

I've gained a lot of inspiration and copied code from the following mods:
- https://github.com/Tonius/SimplyJetpacks
- https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderCore
- https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO

Their licenses allowed this and I'm hoping I haven't made any mistakes here!
